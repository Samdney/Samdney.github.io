	<p><i>[oldBl-3] - <b>The future of money</b> - Keyword(s): money, bitcoin, future, mankind, evolution, step - 2016/01/23, 17:22:02 - CET</i></p>
		<p><i>The acquisition of wealth is no longer the driving force in our lives. ...We work to better ourselves ...and the rest of humanity.</i>, Jean-Luc Picard, Star Trek: First Contact, 1996</p>

		<p>The last days, the Bitcoin price went down again, which gave me the reason to think about the general question what should be the money of the future and if we really need money for a working society. I think the answers to this questions are depending on some boundary conditions. In particular from the main one: "Will the humanity be able to overcome all its small problems?" Permanent humans are more busied with themselves and among themselves and not with the issues which should be the real aims of mankind. To work together, searching for the sense of life but together and not against each other. Where could the humanity already be today without all this wars and conflicts in our history? I think at a point so far away that we are not able to imagine it.</p>
		
		<p>This leads me to the citation above and the question "For what aim we are working?" at the moment. First it's a very private question. "For what YOU are working in YOUR life?" and secondly "For what aim of humanity WE are working?". But this two parts belong together. Star Trek is talking about a future within which money doesn't exist anymore. Within which wars between humans don't exist anymore. Within which poverty doesn't exist anymore. Is this realistic?</p>

		<p>I think exactly this three points are the basis and also belong inseparably together. The humanity will only has a future if we will able to see further like the most people do it today. The reasons for our conflicts on our planets are very stupid. They are intolerance, egotism, the wish to have power, ... . Assume all this reasons wouldn't exist. All people would be tolerant, helpful, to be willing to compromise, don't want to the has power, ... . Would be our understanding for the esteem of the effort of a person still the same like today? No. Today we show it by money. The ideal case is: more effort more money. But the reality is different. On the one hand the problem of the question "What is effort?" and on the other hand the fact that this direct proportionality doesn't exist. Examples are the price building of art or the salaries of all the high-end manager.</p>

		<p>Ok. Today, the money system doesn't seem to be the right solution. But if we would live in this utopian world above, we wouldn't need it. The priorities in our all lifes will automatically change. Our understanding of effort and also richness will change. Money will be waste if everbody is in his or her personal developement matured to the most important point in human evolution. If the whole mankind will has reached this point also poverty doesn't exist anymore because it's a result of the behavior of all of us.</p>

		<p>Now, back to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. When it started it was a great idea. Something new, something different and something which is a little bit going to the utopian direction above with its decentralized concept. But, it is still a kind of money. I think cryptocurrencies are the first very small step to an other understanding of money. The world I described is mainly depending from the question if we as humanity want it. This aim can't reach in a short time. Evolution needs time and a lot of small step. Bitcoin is one of them.</p>

		<p>At the moment, Bitcoin seems to have problems. Perphaps it will come soon to its end. But this is ok. Evolution needs this coming and going. It's time to think about the next step and we should use it now. A kind of money which not only bases of the power of your mining machine or your money pouch of classical currency. It should also include the true understandig of effort. How? That's a hard question. The true: I don't know but perhaps people who read this.</p>

		<p>Reflect about my words and if you want to be one of the persons to bring the mankind forward or not.</p>

		<p>Now some people will say "You have watched too much science fiction!" and I will say "Yes". Everybody should have utopian dreams.</p>

	<p><i>[oldBl-2] - <b>32c3 - Personally Review - "Grundrechte gelten nicht im Weltall!"</b> - Keyword(s): 32c3, NSA - 2016/01/02, 05:59:51 - CET</i></p>
		<p><i>German version below</i></p>
		<p>Four days gone so quickly. Met old friends, found new friends and listened to some talks. My personally favorite: "Grundrechte gelten nicht im Weltall!" (Stream on <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/32c3-7225-grundrechte_gelten_nicht_im_weltall#video" title="External: media.ccc.de" target="_blank">media.ccc.de</a>). It was very funny, but that is also exactly the point. If it would not be true, it would be the best theater show I have ever seen.</p>

		<p>But sadly it is true. Humans like to play roles. How easy would be the world if everbody whould be more directly. Saying what they really think, not what they have to say. In particular in this case. Think about all the recourses which are used for this. The costs, the time and all the other things. Where could be the human race today if we would use all this power really to solve the problems of this world. Really sadly.</p>
 
		<p>That were my mind during watching this talk.</p>

	<p><i>[oldBl-1] - <b>32c3 - Persönlicher Rückblick - "Grundrechte gelten nicht im Weltall!"</b> - Keyword(s): 32c3, NSA - 2016/01/02, 05:59:51 - CET</i></p>
		<p>Vier Tage sind so schnell vergangen. Ich traf alte Freunde, fand Neue und hörte einige Vorträge. Mein persönlicher Favorit: "Grundrechte gelten nicht im Weltall!" (Stream auf <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/32c3-7225-grundrechte_gelten_nicht_im_weltall#video" title="External: media.ccc.de" target="_blank">media.ccc.de</a>). Er war sehr lustig, aber das ist auch genau der Punkt. Wenn es nicht war wäre, wäre es die beste Theateraufführung, die ich je gesehen habe.</p>

		<p>Aber leider ist es wahr. Menschen mögen es Rollen zu spielen. Wie leicht wäre die Welt, wenn jeder direkter wäre. Sagend, was sie wirklich denken, nicht was sie müssen. Insbesondere in diesem Fall. Man bedenke all die Ressourcen die hierfür genutzt werden. Die Kosten, die Zeit und all die anderen Dinge. Wo könnte die Menschheit heute sein, wenn wir all diese Energie wirklich dazu nutzen würden, die Probleme dieser Welt zu lösen. Das ist wirklich traurig.</p>

		<p>Das waren meine Gedanken, wärend ich diesem Vortrag lauschte.</p>
